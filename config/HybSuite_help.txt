Latest version: 1.1.0

[1] Before running HybSuite, you have to prepare:

=====>>> Necessary folder and textfiles <<<=====
> FOLDER: You have to prepare the input folder which contains nescessary txt files.
            The absolute directory of the input folder: <input directory> needs to be specified by the parameter '-i'.

> TEXTFILES:
->Species names list (Including ingroup and outgroup):
  According to your needs:
  You must provide at least one of the following two types of species names lists in the <input directory> specified by the parameter '-i'.
  And you must set the same filenames as follows.
  Type1: SRR_Spname.txt                 The list of SRR numbers and their corresponding species names.
                                        (the first column is SRR number, the second column is the species name corresponding to each SRR number, separated by tab, "\t")

  Type2: My_Spname.txt                  The name list of new species which are sequenced by yourself and haven't been cleaned before. (include ingroups and outgroups)"
                                        If you provide this textfile, you must set the option "-my_raw_data" to specify the directory of your new raw data in the format of fastq/fastq.gz.

->Outgroup names list (Only including outgroup names):
  Outgroup.txt                          The name list of your outgroups. (No number limitation)
